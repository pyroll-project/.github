Welcome to The PyRolL Project!

PyRolL is an OpenSource rolling framework, aimed to provide a fast and extensible base for rolling simulation. The
current focus lies on groove rolling using models build on analytical solutions in elongation grooves. 
The project is structured in numerous repositories, where every repository either contains an extension or a plugin to the framework. 
Need more information regarding the way PyRolL works? Check out our [documentation](https://pyroll.readthedocs.io/en/latest)!

## Project Structure
The structure of the project is build around the [pyroll-core](https://github.com/pyroll-project/pyroll-core) repository which hosts the calculation core. 
Generally the version numbers major has to match to use a respective plugin or extension with the core.
