Welcome to The PyRolL Project!

PyRolL is an OpenSource rolling framework, aimed to provide a fast and extensible base for rolling simulation. The
current focus lies on groove rolling in elongation grooves. The core package includes the basic data structures and
algorithms. Further functionality is provided
via [extension packages](https://pyroll.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/index.html) and model approaches are
provided via [plugin packages](https://pyroll.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/index.html).
